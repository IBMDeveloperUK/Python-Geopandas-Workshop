# Explore UK Crime Data with Pandas and Geopandas

In this series of workshops you will learn about geospatial data. The workshop is aimed at people who are interested in data science and data analysis.

During the workshop we will analyse London borough and crime data with Python, Pandas and GeoPandas in a Jupyter notebook. We first will look at the properties of geospatial data and explore the different commands. After you have learned the basics we will go through some exercises analysing the UK Crime Data to explore patterns and trends and create a few maps of crime rates in London.

In this workshop we will use Watson Studio to run a Jupyter notebook. For this you will need an IBM Cloud account (or run the notebooks locally when you comfortable with this). Follow along with the steps of each workshop that will guide you through all the steps to get started.
