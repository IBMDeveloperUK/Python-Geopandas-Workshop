## Jupyter notebooks in Watson Studio <a id="jupyter-notebooks-in-watson-studio"></a>

Let's start by setting up a project where you can store data, notebooks and many other assets.

Within the project we will use Jupyter notebooks that allow you to create and share documents containing live code, equations, visualisations and explanatory text. We will be using a number of notebooks in Watson Studio throughout this workshop. These notebooks are contained in a project that you will import into your Watson Studio instance.

### Create a project <a id="create-a-project"></a>

Click on **Start working** to create a project that will contain all the assets for this workshop:

![](https://github.com/MargrietGroenendijk/gitbooks/blob/master/.gitbook/assets/screenshot-2020-08-21-at-16.50.56.png)

In the next screen click on **Create an empty project**. Then give your new project a name and click on Create in the bottom right:

![](https://github.com/MargrietGroenendijk/gitbooks/blob/master/.gitbook/assets/screenshot-2020-09-03-at-10.50.45.png)

Your previously created Object Storage should be added automatically as above. But it is possible you have to select it from a drop-down menu first.

**Welcome to your new project!** Here you can store notebooks, data and much more. You can also add collaborators, schedule jobs and customise runtime environments. 

Click on **Add to project** at the top right and you will see the below menu with a list of all assets you can add. Click on **Notebook** to add one.

![](https://github.com/MargrietGroenendijk/gitbooks/blob/master/.gitbook/assets/screenshot-2020-09-03-at-10.56.21.png)

This will bring you here, where you can create a new notebook, add one from a local file or from a URL:

![](https://github.com/MargrietGroenendijk/gitbooks/blob/master/.gitbook/assets/screenshot-2020-09-03-at-11.22.15.png)

To load the notebook for this workshop, select **From URL**, give the notebook a name, paste the below link to the notebook in the **Notebook URL** field and then click the **Create** button at the bottom right. You can leave the runtime as the default.
